# 🚀 Next.js Repository

## Overview
This repository is built with **Next.js**, a React framework for creating fast, scalable, and modern web applications.  
Next.js provides features like server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), API routes, and optimized performance out of the box.

## Why Next.js?
Next.js is chosen because it:
- Simplifies **routing** with a file-based system.
- Offers **SSR and SSG** for better SEO and performance.
- Provides **API routes** so backend logic can live inside the same project.
- Integrates seamlessly with **Vercel** for deployment.
- Supports **TypeScript** and modern CSS solutions (Tailwind, CSS Modules, Styled Components).

## Use Cases
- **Portfolio sites** with fast load times and SEO optimization.
- **E-commerce platforms** needing dynamic product pages and server-side rendering.
- **Blogs or content sites** using static generation for speed.
- **Dashboards and SaaS apps** combining frontend and backend logic in one framework.
